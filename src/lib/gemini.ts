3. Confidence: Your confidence level in the identification (as a percentage)
4. Description: A brief description of the pest or disease in 1-2 sentences
5. Causes: List 2-3 main causes or conditions that lead to this pest or disease
6. Control Methods:
   a. Chemical Control: For each chemical control option (limit to 2), provide:
      - Name of the chemical/product
      - Active Ingredient (format as: "Active ingredient 25 g/L EC")
      - Application Rate (e.g., "1 ml/L water")

   b. Organic Control: For each organic control option (limit to 1), provide:
      - Name of the organic solution
      - Active Ingredient
      - Application Rate
   c. Cultural Control: List 3-5 cultural practices to prevent or manage the issue
7. Plants Affected: List of crops commonly affected by this pest or disease (limit to 5)
